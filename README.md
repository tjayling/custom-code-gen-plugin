# Custom Code Gen IntelliJ plugin
### Some useful code generators for basic package structure and micro-types.
#### Adds two options to the new file menu:
- Domain: Generates a basic package structure for a project, including a controller, service, repository and domain package structure along with the corresponding classes, all wired together for you.
- Microtype: Generates a basic microtype template. You give your type a name, and the type that it will be encapsulating, and an Object and NoObject are generated with inheritance and isPresent methods.
